# Random Walk Visualization

In this project, I use Python to generate data for a random walk and employ Matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of that data. A random walk is a path determined by a series of simple decisions, each made entirely by chance. This can be imagined as the erratic path of an ant that takes each step in a random direction.

Random walks have practical applications across various fields such as nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics. For example, the movement of a pollen grain on the surface of water, driven by molecular motion, is a real-world instance of a random walk. The code we write models these kinds of real-world situations.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to generate random walk data and visualize it using Matplotlib. By simulating random walks, we gain insights into various natural and scientific phenomena where randomness plays a crucial role.

## Features
- Generate data for random walks.
- Visualize random walks with Matplotlib.
- Customize the appearance of the random walk plot.

## Installation
To get started with the Random Walk Visualization project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-walk-visualization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd random-walk-visualization
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the random walk simulation and generate the visualization, use the following command:
```bash
python random_walk.py
```
The resulting plot will be displayed, showing the path of the random walk.
